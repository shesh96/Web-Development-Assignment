1) What is the difference between UI and UX?
UI (User Interface) refers to how a product looks. It includes design elements such as buttons,
colors, fonts, icons, and layout. UI focuses on visual appearance and presentation.
UX (User Experience) refers to how a product feels when someone uses it. It focuses on usability,
ease of navigation, and overall user satisfaction. UX ensures the product is simple and effective to
use.
In short, UI is about design, while UX is about experience.
